            Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, 
            and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. 
            Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. 
            Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the 
            way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

            Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, 
            primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.

            A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations.In most 
            regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age.
            There is a movement for education reform, and in particular for evidence-based education.

             The History Of Education
         </p>

            Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society.
            In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and 
            skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily 
            learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.

            Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe.The city of 
            Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle 
            of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE. European 
            civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.

            The world is changing at an ever quickening rate, which means that a lot of knowledge becomes obsolete and inaccurate 
            more quickly. The emphasis is therefore shifting to teaching the skills of learning: to picking up new knowledge 
            quickly and in as agile a way as possible.[citation needed] Finnish schools have even begun to move away from the 
            regular subject-focused curricula, introducing instead developments like phenomenon-based learning, where students 
            study concepts like climate change instead.[100] There are also active educational interventions to implement programs 
            and paths specific to non-traditional students, such as first generation students.

            Education is also becoming a commodity no longer reserved for children.[citation needed] Adults need it too.
            Some governmental bodies, like the Finnish Innovation Fund Sitra in Finland, have even proposed compulsory lifelong 
            education.
